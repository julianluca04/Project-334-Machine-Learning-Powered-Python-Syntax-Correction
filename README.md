# Project-334-Machine-Learning-Powered-Python-Syntax-Correction
This is the student led project 334: "Machine Learning–Powered Python Syntax Correction". 
The aim is to create a machine learning model that is able to correct syntax errors within 
python code allowing for easier correction while coding as well as understanding how machine learning works.


Below is the project description as provided in the project selection manual: 

    Although Python is widely used for teaching and research, students often struggle with syntax errors. Small 
    mistakes, such as missing colons or mismatched brackets, prevent code from running and slow down learning
    and development. While IDEs (integrated development environments), like VSCode, and linters flag issues, 
    they rarely suggest precise corrections. Large genAI tools can fix errors, but in a “black box” way that 
    does not advance our understanding of how syntax errors are detected and resolved. This project will 
    investigate how machine learning models can be adapted to detect and correct Python syntax errors. Therefore, 
    this project aims to design a small-scale prototype, “PyFixer, ” that detects and corrects Python syntax errors. 
    Students will work with a manageable dataset of real and synthetic errors, train and adapt an existing model, 
    analyze which types of errors are most common or hardest to fix, and evaluate the effectiveness of machine 
    learning approaches. In this project, students will build a small but functional syntax-correcting tool 
    prototype, gaining hands-on experience in Python coding, model fine-tuning, and user interface design, as 
    well as in research activities such as dataset preparation and model evaluation. Students will also deepen 
    their understanding of machine learning principles and natural language processing applied to code.
